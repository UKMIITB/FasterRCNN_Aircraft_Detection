# FasterRCNN_Aircraft_Detection
Faster RCNN model for aircraft detection and localisation in satellite images and creating a webpage with live server for public usage

This project was aimed at creating an faster RCNN model, train on satellite based aircraft images, perform image augmentation to increase data size, 
and finally use the trained model to deploy it on web server with backend as google colab to have an online platform for prediction wherein user can 
upload any image and get the detection and bounding box for aircrafts present if any
